	<p>Ernesto Guevara was born to Ernesto Guevara Lynch and Celia de la Serna y Llosa, on 14 June 1928,[4] in Rosario, Argentina. Although the legal name on his birth certificate was "Ernesto Guevara", his name sometimes appears with "de la Serna" and/or "Lynch" accompanying it.[20] He was the eldest of five children in an upper-class Argentine family of pre-independence Spanish (i.e. Basque and Cantabrian) and Irish ancestry.[21][22][23] Two of Guevara's notable 18th century ancestors included Luis María Peralta, a prominent Spanish landowner in colonial California, and Patrick Lynch, who emigrated from Ireland to the Río de la Plata Governorate.[24][25] Referring to Che's "restless" nature, his father declared "the first thing to note is that in my son's veins flowed the blood of the Irish rebels".

Early on in life, Ernestito (as he was then called) developed an "affinity for the poor".[27] Growing up in a family with leftist leanings, Guevara was introduced to a wide spectrum of political perspectives even as a boy.[28] His father, a staunch supporter of Republicans from the Spanish Civil War, often hosted many veterans from the conflict in the Guevara home.

Despite suffering crippling bouts of acute asthma that were to afflict him throughout his life, he excelled as an athlete, enjoying swimming, football, golf, and shooting, while also becoming an "untiring" cyclist.[30][31] He was an avid rugby union player,[32] and played at fly-half for Club Universitario de Buenos Aires.[33] His rugby playing earned him the nickname "Fuser"—a contraction of El Furibundo (furious) and his mother's surname, de la Serna—for his aggressive style of play.</p>

<p> Che Guevara developed a series of ideas and concepts that has become known as guevarism. His thinking took anti-imperialism, Marxism as a basic element, but with reflections on how to carry out a revolution and create a socialist society that gave him its own identity.</p>
<h1>motorcycle journey</h1>
<p>Before Che Guevara became a Marxist guerilla commander, before he became a revolutionary icon emblazoned on T-shirts, before he was even known as “Che,” there was a buddy, a bike and an epic road trip that would change the course of his life and world history.

In December 1951, 23-year-old Argentine medical student Ernesto Rafael Guevara de la Serna hopped on the back of his friend Alberto Granado’s antiquated Norton 500cc motorcycle and sped out of Cordoba, Argentina. “All we could see was the dust on the road ahead and ourselves on the bike, devouring kilometers in our flight northward,” Guevara wrote.

In spite of a six-year age difference, Guevara and Granado, a 29-year-old biochemist, had been friends for nearly a decade. The duo shared an intellectual curiosity and a hunger for adventure as they embarked on an odyssey up the spine of South America.</p>
<h1>revolution</h1>
<p>
Che Guevara was a prominent communist figure in the Cuban Revolution who went on to become a guerrilla leader in South America. Executed by the Bolivian army in 1967, he has since been regarded as a martyred hero by generations of leftists worldwide.</p>
<h1>death</h1>
<p>Fifty years ago, the news spread rapidly around the world: Che Guevara was dead, again, and this time, it seemed likely to be true.

Still, news organizations were wary. The day after he was shot to death in a village schoolhouse by Bolivian forces, the third sentence of a front-page New York Times article warned, “Mr. Guevara, 39 years old, has been reported killed or captured before.”

That caution was warranted, such was the legend of Guevara, whose symbolism was growing only more powerful. As his image evolved from an emblem of leftist movements to a more general badge of defiance, it was harnessed as a marketing tool. Later, many marveled at how, in death, the communist revolutionary had been put to work for capitalism.</p>
